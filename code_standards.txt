1. PEP 8 (The Official Python Style Guide)
This is the baseline standard for Python code formatting.

Naming Conventions:

Classes (PascalCase): UserCreate, UserVerify (e.g., Capitalized words, no underscores).

Variables/Fields (snake_case): mobile_number, otp_code (e.g., Lowercase with underscores).

Constants (UPPER_CASE): PHONE_REGEX.

Imports: Grouped correctly (Standard library datetime, re first, then third-party pydantic).

2. Pydantic V2 (Modern Data Validation Standard)
You are using Pydantic V2, which is the latest and fastest version of the library.

model_config = ConfigDict(...): This is the V2 replacement for the old class Config: (V1). It provides better type checking for configuration.

@field_validator: This is the V2 replacement for the old @validator.

Field(...): You are correctly using Field to attach metadata (descriptions) and constraints (min_length, pattern) directly to the model attributes.

3. PEP 484 (Type Hinting)
You are explicitly using type hints (str, int, bool, datetime).

This allows tools like Pylance (VS Code) and MyPy to catch bugs before you run the code (e.g., passing a number where a string is expected).

4. E.164 (International Phone Number Standard)
Your Regex (^\+3538\d{8}$) enforces the E.164 format specifically for Ireland.

Standard: E.164 requires the format [+][Country Code][Subscriber Number].

Your Implementation: You strictly enforce the Irish Country Code (+353) and the mobile prefix (8), ensuring data consistency before it ever reaches your database or Twilio.
